This project is subproject of the wishAutomation script. The previous project, wishAutomation.sh can be used to send emails to people on thier birthday or anniversaries. 
This project is used to send text messages to people on thier birthday/Anniversaries. For this project we are usin the method metined on this page( http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/203751/is-there-any-way-to-send-sms-to-a-mobile-number-using-shell-script) to send texts to peple. To save the user info for this project we will have to save the cell phone carrier along with phone numbers, birthday and names. We can use the same script from the wishAutomation\_Script project to add people to the file.
This script can be used only within USA, need to research for outside of the USA cell phones.
