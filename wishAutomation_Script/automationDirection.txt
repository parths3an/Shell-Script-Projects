This file provides the direction to how to automatically run the script at the startup. 
There are different ways that we can automatically run this script. 
The best way I found is to run the script after the initial boot up process. 
You can try using @reboot in a cron tab or have the script run in a gnome terminal after the boot up by adding it to the "Startup Application" from search. 
I chose to add the script in rc.local file. This file is located in /home/username/etc.
By default this file is readonly you need to change the access permission. 
The best thing to do would be is: 
sudo chmod 755 rc.local
Now, you will be able to edit the rc.local file. 
Now, redirect the rc.local to your directory where you have the program. To do that do, 
cd /path/to/wishAutomation_Dir
Now, execute the script. 
sh wish.sh 

Now, you can reboot the machine and once it reboots it will send the wish if there is any mathing person for the day to wish. 

This will reduce your efforts  to run the script manually everyday so no need to wish people manually everyday.
