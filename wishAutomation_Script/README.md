This small shell script project helps the user to send occational emails to ceratin user. It can be helpful to send birthday wish, anniversary wishes.The main goal of this project is to automate the sending wishes so even if we forget to wish them on social media/or in real life we will still have sent an email to them. 

Currently we have to run the script manually but in the future it will be completely automated. The script will run when we start our machine. And the script will check on today's date is there anyone to send a wish from a given list. If there is then it will send a with by itself and let you know that what it sent and whom it sent to. If there is no one to wish it will shows you a prompt that there is no one to send a message to. 


The way I learned about this is from this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT-6NbjqjDM
